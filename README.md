# GAM tutorial

This notebook aims at presenting basics of Generalized Additive Models (Hastie & Tibsharani, 1996) in R. 
We use fictitious (though probable) data of a subscription meal box service. 

The presentation was given at PL in ML conference in Warsaw on 15 Dec 2018.

For GAM implementation in Python I recommend looking at:
